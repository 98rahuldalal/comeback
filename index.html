    <h2><br> Hey, Manisha<br></h2>
    <p><br>
       Whatever I will say right now, thoda filmy ya stupid lag sakta h, but bear with me.
When I sent u a connection request on shaadi.com, it was kind of random. As we started talking, I started
to know u through your stories. I don't know how others look at them, but I found your stories lively,
energetic, cute and sometimes beautifully silly. As time passed by, I started liking you more and more.
But as our conversation continued and u said u are very open and not sati-savitri type, I kind of got defensive.
And I thought u are a red flag and started sounding like I was interviewing u.
I must have said something that put u off in that instance. I'm sorry for that, it was not intentional.
But after couple of months, when u again reached out, I realized I was wrong to judge u like that.
You were just direct, bold and straight-forward. Maybe a little-little drama lover.
But I kind of liked it, it gave core jat vibes and what's life without a little bit drama.
But here’s the thing—I don’t make the same mistake twice. I misjudged you once, but now I see you for who you really are.
And let’s be honest, life’s too short for missed opportunities. So, what do you say?
